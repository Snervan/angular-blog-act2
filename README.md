# Angular Blog Activity 2

## About 

Following the instructions of the activity 2 from Angular' course on OpenClassrooms. I made a Blog app style where we can add a Post, delete One or view one of them on a single page. This is a personal work in order to learn how I can made a web app with Angular.

Every post you add or see is from a public Firebase database. Using a firebase package (not AngularFire).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
